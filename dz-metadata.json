The ages of the household members and their relationships to each other are used to derive the number of rooms they require, based on a standard formula. The number of rooms required is subtracted from the number of rooms in the household's accommodation to obtain the occupancy rating. An occupancy rating of -1 implies that a household has one fewer room than required, 0 suggests that a household's accommodation has an ideal number of rooms, and +1 implies that they have one more room than the standard requirement. The number of rooms data are modelled using information from the Land & Property Services Domestic Property List and other sources. Census 2021 did not ask a 'Number of rooms' question.
